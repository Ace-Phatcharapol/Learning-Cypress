### 1. Fork this repo

If you want to experiment with running this project in Continuous Integration, you'll need to [fork](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink#fork-destination-box) it first.

After forking this project in `Github`, run these commands:

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-kitchensink

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8080` which hosts the Kitchen Sink App.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

You should see the Kitchen Sink App up and running. We are now ready to run Cypress tests.

```bash
# launch the cypress test runner
npm run cy:open

# Or launch the cypress test runner
npx cypress open
```

**shortcut:** you can use command `npm run local:open` that uses [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) to start local server and open Cypress. When you close Cypress, the local server is stopped automatically. Similarly you can use `npm run local:run` to start the server, run Cypress tests headlessly and close the server.
